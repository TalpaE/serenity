   * @brief Constructor
   * @param lrscf A controller for the lrscf calculation
   * @param b The sets of guess vectors. Generally, the response problem is non-Hermitian and one can have two sets of
   * guess vectors\n for right (X+Y) and left eigenvectors (X-Y). Per convention, these are stored in b[0] and b[1],
   * respectively.\n For TDA-like problems, the guesses for X are stored in b[0].\n Note that sigma vectors can, albeit
   * not used in the present implementation, also be calculated for more than two sets of test vectors.
   * @param densityScreeningThreshold A prescreening threshold. Often, the matrix of guess vectors is rather sparse and
   * has contributions\n from a few subsystems only, i.e. the density matrices of pure environment systems will be close
   * to zero.\n If the maximum density matrix element of the density matrix of a specific subsystem is lower than this
   * threshold,\n the calculation of the contribution of that block to the sigma vectors is skipped.
   * @param levelShiftParameter The levelshift for the levelshift projection operator.
   * @param eoPot The embedding mode used for the sTDDFT calculation.
