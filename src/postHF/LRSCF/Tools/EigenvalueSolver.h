   * @class EigenvalueSolver
   * @brief A class for the iterative solution of the response problem.\n
   * 
   * This class includes solution techniques for Hermitian and symplectic eigenvalue\n
   * problems, as required by (Hybrid-) TDDFT.\n
   * 
   * For Hermitian problems, the standard Davidson-Liu algorithm will be used and for\n
   * symplectic problems a modified OJJ-Algorithm as proposed by Filip Furche in his\n
   * PhD thesis.\n
   * (F. Furche, GÃ¶ttingen 2002. Fak. f. Chemie, Diss. v. 1.2.2002., PhD thesis, 2002.)\n
   * 
   * Note that the Hermitian solver utilizes non-orthonormal guess spaces for\n
   * convergence acceleration. (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2016 12 (7), 3003-3007)
